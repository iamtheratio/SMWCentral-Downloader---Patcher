==============================

ðŸ›  Description:
This tool allows you to quickly download, patch, and organize Super Mario World ROM hacks. It streamlines your workflow so you can focus on playing!

ðŸ“¦ Included Files:
- main.exe .......... The application launcher
- config.json ....... Configuration file (modify with caution)
- README.txt ........ This help file

ðŸš€ How to Use:
1. Unzip all contents into a folder (recommended: SMWC Downloader V1.0).
2. Double-click `main.exe` to launch the app.
3. Follow these steps inside the application:
   - Browse and select your `flips.exe` app.
   - Browse and select your clean Super Mario World base ROM.
   - Browse and select your output folder (this is the root directory where patched files will go).
   - Configure your download preferences using built-in filters such as:
     - Difficulty (e.g., Newcomer, Expert, Grandmaster)
     - Type (e.g., Standard, Kaizo, Puzzle)
     - SA-1 support
     - Collab hacks

     - And more!
4. The app will automatically:
   - Download and patch selected hacks
   - Organize the output into a clean folder structure
   - Log patch details in a text file for your archive
5. After the first run, a `processed.json` file will be created to track which hacks you've already downloaded. Future sessions will skip previously processed hacks to save time.

ðŸ§  Tips:
- Use only verified clean ROMs for patching.
- Keep `config.json` as-is unless you know what you're editing.
- Your output folder will contain patched ROMs organized for easy access.
